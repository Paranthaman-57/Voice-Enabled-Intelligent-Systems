# Voice-Enabled Intelligent Systems

This project contains three Python programs developed as part of the Naan Mudhalvan Student Implementation.

## Programs

1. **Virtual Customer Support System**
   - Automates responses to customer queries using speech recognition.
   - Uses keywords and intents to deliver fast, accurate answers.

2. **Voice-Controlled Smart Home Assistant**
   - Controls home appliances (like lights, fans) via voice commands.
   - Uses Pythonâ€™s `speech_recognition` and `pyttsx3`.

3. **Voice Command Gaming Assistant**
   - Enables hands-free game control using voice (e.g., jump, fire, reload).
   - Maps spoken commands to keyboard inputs.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Libraries:
  - `speech_recognition`
  - `pyttsx3`
  - `keyboard`
  - `pyaudio`
  - `pandas`

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install SpeechRecognition pyttsx3 keyboard pyaudio pandas
   ```

2. Run each script as needed:
   ```bash
   python virtual_customer_support.py
   python smart_home_assistant.py
   python voice_command_gaming.py
   ```
